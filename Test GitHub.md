# GITHUB

In this document, you will learn - 

- To create the project and make good use of its features.
- To create an open source Repository.
- To create and manage a new Branch.
- To change content of a file and commit (save) the changes in GitHub.
- To open and merge a Pull request.

## Introduction to GitHub:
Git stands for Global Information Tracker and hub means a curated collection of branded content on a specific topic or subject. Github is a SaaS platform for tracking changes, versions and branches of code/project. It lets you and your team mates work together on same project from anywhere in the world.

## Creating a Repository:
A Repository is used to organize a single project by creating files and folders with the help of images, videos, documents, etc. Below are the steps to create new Repository:

**1.**	In the upper-left corner of home page, select **New Repository**.

**2.** In the **Repository name** box, enter the name of your choice.

**3.** In the **Description** box, you can write a short description.

**4.** Select the option **Public/Private** to control that who all can see and commit the Repository.

**5.** In this step you can select single or multiple options to attach the file as per your project requirement.


**6.** Click on **Create repository**.

**NOTE:** After opening the Repository, enter the name of project ending with “.md”

## Creating a Branch:
-	Branch here means to have different versions of a repository at one time. By default, your repository has one branch named main that is considered to be the definitive branch. You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main.
-	When you create a branch of the main branch, you're making a copy of main as it was at that point in time. If someone else makes changes to the main branch while you are working on your branch, you can pull in those updates.

Below are the four steps and diagram which will help you to understand the process:

**1.**	Click the "**Code**" tab in your Repository.

**2.**	Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says "**main**".

**3.**	Find or create a "**branch name**" into the text box.

**4.**	Click "**Create branch: ‘New branch’**" from ‘**main**’.

Now you have two branches and they look exactly the same. Now you can add or make changes to the new branch.

## Committing changes:

-	When you created a new branch in the previous step, GitHub brought you to the code page for your new branch, which is a copy of main.
-	You can make and save changes to the files in your repository. On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. 
-	Each commit has an associated commit message, which is basically a description explaining why a particular change was made.
-	Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what changes you’ve made and why

You can use the below special characters to make the writing more attractive and easy to understand:

Use of hash (#) to make the project attractive - 

-  #Enter the text  :  Use “#” in the starting of the sentence to make texts in Very large Bold size.
-	 ##Enter the text  :  Use “##” in the starting of the sentence to make the text in Large Bold size.
-  ###Enter the text  :  Use “###” in the starting of the sentence to make the text in Medium Bold size.
-	 ####Enter the text  :  Use “####” in the starting of the sentence to make the text only in Normal Bold size.

## Opening a Pull request:

-	**Change-Request-Merge:** With the help of pull request, you do propose the changes you have made and request to review and pull in your part of contribution and merge them into their branch. 
-	**Different colours:** Pull requests show diffs, or differences in the content from both branches. The additions and subtractions in the content will be shown in different colours.
-	**Discussion:** As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.
-	**Mention:** By using @mention feature in pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams.

Below is the process to create Pull Request - 

- Click Create **Pull request**.
- Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes. You can include emojis and drag and drop images and gifs.
- Click Create **Pull request.**

Your Collaborators/Teammates can now review your edits and make suggestions.

## Merging your Pull request:

In this final step, you will merge your new branch into the main branch.

**1.** Click **Merge pull request** to merge the changes into main.

**2.** Click **Confirm merge**.

**3.** Go ahead and delete the branch by clicking **Delete branch** as its changes have been incorporated.
